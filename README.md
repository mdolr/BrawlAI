# Brawl-AI
A weekend project to try reinforcement learning with an AI that learns to play [Brawlhalla](https://www.brawlhalla.com/) (a PvP fighting game), the bot is set to train on a custom map with a black background, white platforms (see custom assets). The bot can train in practice mode thanks to a custom environment that plays directly using a screen capture as inputs and the keyboard as output.
